# Function to measure cosine distance between face descriptors. 
# It is useful to be able to take in a shape-(M, D) array of M descriptor vectors and a shape-(N, D) array of N descriptor vectors
# and compute a shape-(M, N) array of cosine distances â€“ this holds all MxN combinations of pairwise cosine distances.
